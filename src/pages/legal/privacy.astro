                personal data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Contract – We need to process your personal data to fulfill a
                contract with you.

                Legitimate Interests – We have a legitimate interest in

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Use Your Information</h2>

            We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third
            parties. We use your information only to:
        </p>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Children</h2>
        <p>
            As Roblox has a large number of users under 13, we rely on Roblox’s
            parental controls and do not offer additional sign-ups requiring
            personal data from children under 13. We also take additional steps
            to protect children’s privacy:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                We do not knowingly collect additional personal data from
                children under 13.
            </li>
            <li>
                We only store minimal necessary game data (e.g., user progress,
                in-game purchases).
            </li>
            <li>
                If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided personal
                data without verifiable parental consent, we will delete the
                data upon request.
            </li>
            <li>
                Parents can review their child’s personal data and request
                deletion by contacting us at <a
                    href="mailto:support@labdinos.com">support@labdinos.com</a
                >.
            </li>
